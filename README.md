# HandsonML
This repository contains my notebooks which I used them to learn fundamentals of machine learning. I read [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)
for this goal. I created a new jupyter notebook for every chapter that I read. There is also a [github repository](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2) for this book.


There are also some `submodules` which are kaggle competitions that I contributed during this learning process.
